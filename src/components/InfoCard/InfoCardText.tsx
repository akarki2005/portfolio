                I'm a second-year computer science student at the University of Toronto, passionate
                about game and software development, as well as machine learning and data science.

                When I'm not busy coding away at something, you can usually find me working out at
                the gym or playing sports. I also love to cook, and am always experimenting with new dishes!
